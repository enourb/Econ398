## Introduction
The data I have attained thusfar are Zillow's housing data and ACS 2015-2019 data. Both data sets are at the zip code level of granularity. 
I have data for all U.S. zip codes but for the purposes of this analysis I restrict the sample to zip codes within the 5 boroughs of New York City.
